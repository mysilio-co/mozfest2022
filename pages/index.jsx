          <h2>What is Web Monetization?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/explainer/">
              Web Monetization
            </a>
            &nbsp; is a proposed W3C standard that enables website visitors with
            the ability to stream micropayments directly to content creators,
            tip to reward particularly good content, and even gate content on
            payment, providing a viable alternative to advertising based
            buisiness models on the web. Monetizing your site is easy! All you
            need to do is add the following
            <span className="font-mono text-rose-600">{" <meta> "}</span>
            tag to the
            <span className="font-mono text-rose-600">{" <head> "}</span>
            section of all pages on your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-mono text-rose-600">
              {'<meta name="monetization" content="$YourPaymentPointer" />'}
            </span>
          </p>
          <h2>What is Solid?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Social Linked Data</a>, or
            Solid, is a proposed W3C standard for giving users control over
            their online presence and ownship over their data. With Solid
            personal data is stored in shared RDF datastores, and the user can
            upload, revoke, or reshare the data in their datastore at any time,
            with any app. For developers building apps on top of this data,
            Solid provides a rich toolset for data interoperability and storage,
            allowing interactive applications like this one to be built quickly
            without deploying additional backend servers.
